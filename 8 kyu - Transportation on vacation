After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. 
So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. 
The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. 
Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

# Solution
def rental_car_cost(d)
  total = d * 40
  return total -= 50 if d > 6
  d > 2 ? (return total -= 20) : total
end

# Explanation
1. Total is calculated as days * 40
2. Return total by minus 50 if the days are greater than 6
3. If the days are only greater by 2 then return by minus 50
4. Else return the total

# Alternate solution
def rental_car_cost(d)
  return d * 40 if d < 3
  return d * 40 - 20 if d < 7
  return d * 40 - 50
end
